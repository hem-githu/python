        "\n",
        "Ans. Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables:\n",
        "- Independent variable (X): The predictor or input.\n",
        "- Dependent variable (Y): The outcome or response.\n",
        "The relationship is expressed using a straight-line equation:\n",
        "Y=\\c +bX+e\n",
        "- c: Intercept (value of Y when X = 0)\n",
        "- b: Slope (how much Y changes for a one-unit change in X)\n",
        "- e: Error term (captures variability not explained by X)\n",
        "\n",
        "The main goals of Simple Linear Regression are:\n",
        "- Prediction: Estimate the value of the dependent variable (Y) based on a given independent variable (X).\n",
        "Example: Predicting solar power output based on sunlight hours.\n",
        "- Understanding Relationships: Quantify how strongly and in what direction X influences Y.\n",
        "Example: Measuring how temperature affects electricity consumption.\n",
        "- Trend Identification: Detect linear patterns in data to simplify complex relationships.\n",
        "Example: Identifying whether sales increase steadily with advertising spend.\n",
        "- Decision-Making: Provide evidence-based insights for planning, forecasting, and optimization.\n",
        "Example: In solar PV design, regression can help forecast generation based on irradiance levels.\n",

        "b. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors)\n",
        "- The variance of residuals is constant across all values of X.\n",
        "- If variance increases/decreases with X, it’s heteroscedasticity.\n",
        "- Example: Forecast errors should not systematically grow with higher irradiance levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "c. Normality of Errors\n",
        "- Residuals should be normally distributed.\n",
        "- This is cru\n",
        "\n",
        "d. No Perfect Multicollinearity (only relevant in multiple regression, but worth noting)\n",
        "- Since SLR uses only one predictor, this assumption is automatically satisfied.\n",
        "\n",
        "e.  X is Measured Without Error\n",
