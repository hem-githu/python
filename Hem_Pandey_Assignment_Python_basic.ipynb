        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Core Features of Python**\n",
        "Readable Syntax,\n",
        "Dynamic Typing,\n",
        "Multi-Paradigm,\n",
        "Cross-Platform,\n",
        "Extensive Libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Reasons Python Is So Popular**:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Simplicity & Readability:Python’s syntax is clean and intuitive—almost like\n",
        "writing in English.\n",
        "*   Versatility Across Domains:Used in web development, data science, machine learning, automation, IoT, and more.\n",
        "*   Massive Ecosystem:Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Flask, and Django make it powerful out of the box.\n",
        "*   Beginner-Friendly:Ideal for first-time coders and non-programmers.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Strong Community Support:Millions of developers contribute tutorials, packages, and forums.\n",
        "*   Industry Adoption:Used by companies like Google, YouTube, NASA, and Netflix.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. An interpreter in Python is the program that reads your code and executes it line by line, translating it into actions your computer can understand. It’s what makes Python an interpreted language, rather than a compiled one like C or Java.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. In Python, pre-defined keywords are special reserved words that have fixed meanings and are part of the language's syntax. We cannot use them as variable names, function names, or identifiers. example: if, else, elif, for, while, break, continue, pass.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Nope—Python keywords cannot be used as variable names. These are reserved words that define the structure and logic of the language, so trying to use them as identifiers will throw a syntax error.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Mutability in Python refers to whether an object’s internal state (its data) can be changed after it’s created. Example: list, dict, set, custom classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. The difference in mutability between lists & tuples isn’t arbitrary; it’s intentional & serves distinct purposes in how Python handles data structures.\n",
        "**Lists Are Mutable Because…**\n",
        "* Designed for dynamic data: Lists are meant to grow, shrink, and change. You can append, remove, or modify elements freely.\n",
        "* Use cases: Ideal for scenarios where data changes over time—like toggling module types, updating cost blocks, or iterating over bid scenarios.\n",
        "* Memory layout: Lists use a flexible memory allocation strategy that allows resizing and in-place updates.\n",
        "**Tuples Are Immutable Because…**\n",
        "* Designed for fixed data: Tuples are meant to represent constant, unchangeable collections—like coordinates, regulatory constants, or config flags.\n",
        "* Hashability: Because they don’t change, tuples can be used as dictionary keys or set members, unlike lists.\n",
        "* Performance: Tuples are faster to create and access, and Python can optimize their storage and lookup.\n",
        "* Safety: Immutability prevents accidental changes, which is critical in multi-threaded or functional programming contexts.\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. '==' Operator perform Equality Check, Compares values of two objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "'is' Operator perform Identity Check, Compares memory addresses (object identity).Returns True only if both variables point to the exact same object.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Logical operators in Python are used to combine or manipulate Boolean expressions—expressions that evaluate to either True or False. They’re essential for decision-making, conditional flows, and writing clean, readable control logic. Example: and, or, not.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Type casting in Python is the process of converting a value from one data type to another.\n",
        "**Two Types of Type Casting:**\n",
        "* Implicit Type Casting\n",
        "* Explicit Type Casting\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Difference:\n",
        "* Implicit Type Casting (Automatic): Python automatically converts one data type to another when needed—usually to avoid data loss.\n",
        "* Explicit Type Casting (Manual): We tell Python to convert the type using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.  What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Conditional statements in Python are the decision-makers of program code. They allow program to choose different paths of execution based on whether certain conditions are true or false. Act as the logic gates that control what happens next. **Purpose of Conditional Statements:**\n",
        "* Control Flow: They determine which block of code runs, depending on the situation.\n",
        "* Dynamic Behavior: Your program can respond to user input, data values, or external conditions.\n",
        "* Error Handling: You can catch and respond to invalid inputs or unexpected states.\n",
        "* Efficiency: Avoids executing unnecessary code, saving time and resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.  How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. The elif statement in Python stands for “else if”, and it’s used to check multiple conditions in a clean, readable way. It comes after an initial if and before an optional else, allowing your program to evaluate conditions sequentially until one is true. If none of the if or elif conditions are True, it runs the else block (if present).\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "* for Loop — Iterate Over a Sequence,Use when you know how many times you want to loop. Ideal for looping over lists, tuples, strings, ranges, or any iterable.\n",
        "* while Loop — Run Based on a Condition, Use when you want to loop until a condition is no longer true. Ideal for indefinite repetition, like waiting for user input or monitoring a system state.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Financial modeling for new project’s IRR and want to simulate financing scenarios until the IRR exceeds a target (say, 14%). You don’t know how many iterations it’ll take, because it depends on dynamic inputs like tax depreciation, wheeling losses, or module efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, while is ideal because the loop continues until a condition is met, not for a fixed number of steps."
